## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _18.904_ _Seminar in Topology_ as it was taught by Dr. Andrew Snowden in Spring 2011.

Seminar in Topology is an [undergraduate math seminar](http://mathcomm.org/courses/course-structure/). As with all such seminars, the majority of lectures for this class are given by the students as part of their coursework. Students also write a final expository paper. This particular seminar serves as an introduction to algebraic topology at an advanced undergraduate level.

Additional information and resources related to MIT's undergraduate math seminars and teaching mathematical communication are available on the [MathDL Mathematical Communication](http://mathcomm.org/) website.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- To develop mathematical communication skills, including writing and presenting

## Student Information

### Enrollment

9 students

### Breakdown by Year

The students were a mix of sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

### Breakdown by Major

All students were math majors.

### Enrollment Cap

Enrollment in undergraduate math seminars is limited to 12 in order to give students ample opportunity to present. Preference is given to mathematics majors. Beyond that, priority is given to students who have not taken the course before and to students who are closer to degree completion.
